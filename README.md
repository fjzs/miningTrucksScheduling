# Mining Trucks Scheduling
This was my Master's Thesis from my Operations Research program at my University in Chile. It's unfortunately mostly written in Spanish, but if you want to ask me something don't hesitate to contact me.

## Technologies used
* I used C# language to model the backend connected with an API to CPLEX software to solve the optimization models.
* The optimization model is written in AMPL language.
